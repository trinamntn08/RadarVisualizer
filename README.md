# Radar Visualizer
![Radar Visualization](intro.gif)
## Overview
The **Radar Visualizer** project serves as a template for developing radar visualization applications using OpenGL. This project provides a structured starting point, enabling developers to efficiently create and manipulate radar data visualizations.

## Objective
The primary goal of the Radar Visualizer is to demonstrate how to set up a basic framework for visualizing radar information. It includes essential components such as data generation, rendering with OpenGL, and a user-friendly interface to interact with radar data.

## Features
- **OpenGL Integration**: Leverage the power of OpenGL for high-performance rendering of radar data.
- **Modular Design**: Easily extend the project to incorporate additional features, such as advanced data processing and more complex visual representations.
- **Shader Support**: Includes a basic setup for managing and using shaders, allowing for customizable visual effects.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- CMake (version 3.10 or higher)
- A C++ compiler (e.g., GCC, Clang, MSVC)
- OpenGL
- GLFW
- GLAD
- GLM

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/trinamntn08/RadarVisualizer.git
   cd RadarVisualizer
2. Create a build directory and navigate to it:
   ```bash
   mkdir build
   cd build
3. Run CMake to generate the solution:
   ```bash
   cmake ..

4. Build the project:
   ```bash
   cmake --build

### Running the Application
After building the project, you can run the executable from the bin directory.
